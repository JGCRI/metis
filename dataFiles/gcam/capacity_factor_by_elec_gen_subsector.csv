# Hydrogen fuel cells from: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35872 and https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/tech-cap-factor.html,
# Values calculated from an average of the capacity factors of the technologies within each subsector,
"# Exceptions: (1) For ""solar"" capacity factor the CSP_storage capacity factor value of 0.65 was excluded from the average. (2) The ""hydro"" capacity factor was sourced from Global CCS Institute ""Renewable power generation costs in 2012: an overview"" - 5.2 Capacity factors for hydropower, since hydropower is calculated endogenously within GCAM. (3) No cogeneration capacity factor ""n CHP"" was given. (4) rooftop_pv was assumed the same as solar average (5) grid_storage assumed to have a high cap factor equal to that of nuclear",
